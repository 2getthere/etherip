Etherip
-------

A Java library for reading and writing tags on AllenBradley Control Logix or Compact Logix
PLCs via the Ethernet/IP protocol (aka Devicenet-over-Ethernet or CIP-over-Ethernet).

This is a Java implementation of the same protocol that
http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/epics/wiki/EtherIP
provides in C combines with EPICS driver/device support
for IOCs.

The Java implementation is currently only the basic read/write library
with unit tests to demonstrate the functionality.

Eventually, this could be connected to an EPICS V4 network server.
